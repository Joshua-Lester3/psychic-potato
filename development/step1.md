## step1

- practice with simple things, but build on main game when we can

vibe:

- dark, mysterious
- cave-like
- story
  - can make decisions
- black and white?
- orthogonical\* (gungeon-like viewpoint)
- good-bad spectrum

story:

- different endings based on decisions :))
- "strange new world"
- cave-like
- good-bad spectrum
- you have obligation to group/people and slowly start to realize the cause isn't good
- goal: become god of realm
  - become powerful being in this realm or go back to old life in different realm?
- npcs, side quests, you can help them and etc.

lore:

- cave-people (like Fremen in Dune), imprisoned, oppressed, (they are the people that have a cause that isn't good)
  - cause that isn't good: wants to take back freedom, but wants to commit genocide against their oppressors

game mechanics:

- rune upgrades (unlockable maneuvering mechanics)
- examples:
  - smash ground
  - dash
  - extra jump
  - wall climb
  - grapple
    - grapple enemy
- there's areas of the map you can't access at first, but must come back to in order to progress
